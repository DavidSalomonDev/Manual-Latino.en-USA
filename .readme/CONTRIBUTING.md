## Process to contribute

- For small collaborations, or corrections in the documentation, follow the following procedure:

  - Open an issue that describes the article you want to write and how it relates to existing content. The content within the docs folder is organized into sections that are organized by content area (for example, ../Operators/). Try to determine the correct folder for your new content.

- For any other major collaboration, follow these steps:
    - **Step 1:** Fork the LatinoDocs/Manual-Latino repository.

    - **Step 2:** Create a branch for your article contributions.

    - **Step 3:** Write / modify your articles.
        -  If you are creating a new theme, you can use the following [template](plantillas/plantilla.rst) as a starting point. 
        
        - Make sure that when creating a new article, it is saved in the correct folder location.
