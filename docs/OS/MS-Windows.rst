The installation of *Latino* on Windows is no different from other programs, the process is the exact same. Download the latest version of Latino from the link below which is the lastest release from our github repository. 


.. admonition:: Download

   :download:`Download Latino <https://github.com/lenguaje-latino/Latino/releases/latest>`  Only for **64 bit** systems

.. attention::This installation was performed on Windows 7 **64bit**, as Latino is not available for **32bit(86x)** systems. To find out if you're using a 64bit MS-Windows system, `click here`_

1. Once the *Latino* installation is downloaded, we proceed to install it by double-clicking it
2. Accept the terms of use
3. De-select the option to create icon on the desktop and select the option **Add PATH**
4. Proceed with the installation
5. Finalize the installation, de-select the run *Latino*

----

* Once the installation is complete, we test run *Latino* from the CMD to confirm that everything is properly installed. To do this we run CMD on Windows and type the command **Latino** and press Enter. If everything goes well, then CMD will run *Latino* as shown in the image.
